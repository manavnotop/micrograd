# micrograd

Overview
This repository contains a Python library that guides you through the implementation of a neural network from scratch. The inspiration for this project comes from the teachings of Andrej Karpathy, a renowned computer scientist and the Director of AI at Tesla. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience for understanding the fundamentals of neural networks, fostering a deep comprehension of the underlying concepts.

Features
Educational Content: Step-by-step implementation of a neural network with detailed explanations for each component.
Conceptual Clarity: Focus on elucidating fundamental concepts to ensure a strong foundation in neural network principles.
No External Dependencies: The library is built using basic Python libraries, avoiding external dependencies to keep the codebase transparent and accessible.
